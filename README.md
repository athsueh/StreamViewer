# StreamViewer
https://streamview.herokuapp.com/

A simple React app that mirrors functionality of YouTube. It is a work in progress, and currently allows the user to search for YouTube videos and watch them in the embedded viewer. It also supports logging in with a Google account, but simply displays the user's username as of now.
